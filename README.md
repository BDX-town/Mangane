# Mangane

Mangane is an alternative frontend for Pleroma, Akkoma and Mastodon with a focus on ease of use, readability and custom branding.

This project is developped for [BDX-town](http://bdx.town/) Akkoma instance. Akkoma is a fork of Pleroma who mostly adds features, exposing them through new API endpoints. As of today, Akkoma and Pleroma API are compatible.

Mangane inherit from Pleroma the native large compatibility with Mastodon API.

Moreover, Mangane already has a feature detection system allowing us to adapt the experience following what platform is used as a backend.

We are speaking about Akkoma here since we are planning to add Akkoma specific features to the project without breaking any existing compatibility.

## :rocket: Deploy on Pleroma/Akkoma

Installing Mangane on an existing Pleroma or Akkoma instance is easy.
Log in with SSH your server and follow those instructions depending on your configuration.

### Download

First you need to download Mangane on your server.

#### For OTP install

```
/opt/pleroma/bin/pleroma_ctl frontend install mangane --ref dist --build-url https://github.com/BDX-town/Mangane/releases/latest/download/static.zip
```
*Note: The pleroma_ctl path may vary on your system, if you are using Akkoma it's probably in /opt/akkoma/bin/*

#### For Mix/Source install

```
mix pleroma.frontend install mangane --ref dist --build-url https://github.com/BDX-town/Mangane/releases/latest/download/static.zip
```

#### With Admin-fe 

If database configuration is enabled, you can also install Mangane from the Admin interface of Pleroma/Akkoma. 
Just fill the form at Frontend/Available like this.

![admin-fe](./docs/admin-ui-1.png)

### Activation

Then you need to activate the frontend so it will be available to your users.

#### Config.exs

Edit your configuration files to add/edit the `config :pleroma, :frontends` section like this 

```
config :pleroma, :frontends,
  primary: %{
    "name" => "mangane",
    "ref" => "dist"
  }
```

##### Admin-fe with database configuration enabled

Just fill the form at Frontend/frontends/Primary like this.

![admin-fe](./docs/admin-ui-2.png)


**That's it!** :tada:

**Mangane FE is now installed.**  
The change will take effect immediately, just refresh your browser tab, and Mangane will replace the default Pleroma FE or Akkoma FE interface. 
You may need to restart Pleroma/Akkoma for the change to take effect.

## :elephant: Deploy on Mastodon

See [Installing Mangane over Mastodon](./docs/administration/mastodon.md).

## How does it work?

Mangane is a [single-page application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that runs entirely in the browser with JavaScript.

It has a single HTML file, `index.html`, responsible only for loading the required JavaScript and CSS.
It interacts with the backend through [XMLHttpRequest (XHR)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

Here is a simplified example with Nginx:

```nginx
location /api {
  proxy_pass http://backend;
}

location / {
  root /opt/soapbox;
  try_files $uri index.html;
}
```

(See [`mastodon.conf`](https://github.com/BDX-town/Mangane/blob/master/installation/mastodon.conf) for a full example.)

Mangane incorporates much of the [Mastodon API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/), [Pleroma API](https://api.pleroma.social/), and more.
It detects features supported by the backend to provide the right experience for the backend.

# Running locally

To get it running, just clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BDX-town/Mangane.git
cd Mangane
```

Ensure that Node.js and Yarn are installed, then install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Finally, run the dev server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

**That's it!** :tada:

It will serve at `http://localhost:3036` by default.

You should see an input box - just enter the domain name of your instance to log in.

Tip: you can even enter a local instance like `http://localhost:3000`!

### Troubleshooting: `ERROR: NODE_ENV must be set`

Create a `.env` file if you haven't already.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

And ensure that it contains `NODE_ENV=development`.
Try again.

## Developing against a live backend

You can also run Mangane FE locally with a live production server as the backend.

> **Note:** Whether or not this works depends on your production server. It does not seem to work with Cloudflare or VanwaNet.

To do so, just copy the env file:

## Local Dev Configuration

The following configuration variables are supported supported in local development.
Edit `.env` to set them.

All configuration is optional, except `NODE_ENV`.

#### `NODE_ENV`

The Node environment.
Mangane checks for the following options:

- `development` - What you should use while developing Mangane FE.
- `production` - Use when compiling to deploy to a live server.
- `test` - Use when running automated tests.

#### `BACKEND_URL`

URL to the backend server.
Can be http or https, and can include a port.
For https, be sure to also set `PROXY_HTTPS_INSECURE=true`.

**Default:** `http://localhost:4000`

#### `PROXY_HTTPS_INSECURE`

Allows using an HTTPS backend if set to `true`.

This is needed if `BACKEND_URL` is set to an `https://` value.
[More info](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48624590/8811886).

**Default:** `false`

# Yarn Commands

The following commands are supported.
You must set `NODE_ENV` to use these commands.
To do so, you can add the following line to your `.env` file:

```sh
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Local dev server
- `yarn dev` - Run the local dev server.

#### Building
- `yarn build` - Compile without a dev server, into `/static` directory.

#### Translations
- `yarn manage:translations` - Normalizes translation files. Should always be run after editing i18n strings.

#### Tests
- `yarn test:all` - Runs all tests and linters.

- `yarn test` - Runs Jest for frontend unit tests.

- `yarn lint` - Runs all linters.

- `yarn lint:js` - Runs only JavaScript linter.

- `yarn lint:sass` - Runs only SASS linter.

* Instance name, site logo and favicon.
* Custom pages: e.g About, Terms of Service page, Privacy Policy page, Copyright Policy (DMCA).
* Promo panel custom links (e.g. link to blog or documentation external site).
* Mangane extensions.
* Default instance settings (e.g. default theme).

Customization details can be found in the [Customization documentation](docs/customization.md)

# Troubleshooting

## Unable to upload some files (notably svg files)

It's a [known issue](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/-/issues/2768#note_97928) with the `exiftool` filter.
To solve these upload problems, go to your admin-fe, search the upload section and remove `exiftool` from the enabled filters.
