Thank you for your interest in Mangane!

When contributing to Mangane, please first discuss the change you wish to make by [opening an issue](https://github.com/BDX-town/Mangane/issues).

## Opening an MR (merge request)

1. Smash that "fork" button on Github to make a copy of the repo.
2. Clone the repo locally, then begin work on a new branch (eg not `master`).
3. Push your branch to your fork.
4. Once pushed, GitLab should provide you with a URL to open a new merge request right in your terminal. If not, do it [manually](https://github.com/BDX-town/Mangane/pulls).
