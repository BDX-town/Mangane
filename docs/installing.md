# Installing Soapbox

This guide is a step-by-step guide for installing Soapbox. These instructions assume that you're using a fresh, new VPS powered by a Debian-based OS such as Ubuntu.

## Install Pleroma

First, follow the instructions to [install Pleroma](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/debian_based_en/) on a fresh VPS. We recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

**Note:** If you followed the directions for installing on Linux with OTP Releases, create the following symlink in the pleroma user's home:
``su pleroma -s $SHELL -lc "ln -s /var/lib/pleroma /opt/pleroma/instance"``

## Install Soapbox

The Soapbox frontend is the main component of Soapbox. Once you've installed Pleroma, installing Soapbox FE is a breeze.

First, ssh into the server and download a .zip of the latest build: ``curl -L https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/soapbox-fe/-/jobs/artifacts/v1.0.0/download?job=build-production -o soapbox-fe.zip``

Then unpack it into Pleroma's ``instance`` directory: ``busybox unzip soapbox-fe.zip -o -d /opt/pleroma/instance``

**That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Soapbox FE is installed.** The change will take effect immediately, just refresh your browser tab. It's not necessary to restart the Pleroma service.
