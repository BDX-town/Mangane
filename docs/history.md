# History

Mangane was created in april 2022, for the [BDX-Town](https://bdx.town/) Akkoma instance. It is based on a fork of Soapbox FE, a custom frontend at this time for Pleroma and Mastodon, developped by Alex Gleason in 2019 for the controversial site Spinster and others. 

The first version of Mangane, “Agressive Capybarra”, was based on version 1.3.2 of Soapbox, later updated on version 2.0 in may 2022. 

From now Mangane is a separate project in regard of Soapbox, with is own agenda, and is own philosophy. Mangane focus on adding to the frontend support for advanced features of Akkoma, still being compatible with Pleroma.
