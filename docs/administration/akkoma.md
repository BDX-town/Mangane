# Akkoma features

Mangane supports some Akkoma features (and will support more features as the time passes).

## Bubble timeline

Akkoma allows the administrators to handpick a few instances to create a new timeline, showing all public posts from said instances.  
Mangane shows a `Curated Timeline` entry in user's settings. If enabled, it will replace the `fediverse timeline` with the Akkoma's `bubble timeline` logged-in users.

## Enhanced post functions

- Schedule post for publishing later.
- Edit your posts, as many times as you want.
- Option to make statuses local only (not federated).
- Translation of statuses for local users.
- Description on uploads for accessibility (empty by default).

Note: at time of writing, most of these features are _not supported_ (or not functional) with Pleroma.

## Chat

Mangane support the chat functionality of Pleroma. This was removed in Akkoma, and is not supported by Mastodon.
