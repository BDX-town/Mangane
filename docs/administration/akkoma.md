# Akkoma features

Mangane supports some Akkoma features (and will support more features as the time passes).

## Bubble timeline

Akkoma allows the administrators to handpick a few instances to create a new timeline, showing all public posts from said instances.  
Mangane shows a `Curated Timeline` entry in user's settings. If enabled, it will replace the `fediverse timeline` with the Akkoma's `bubble timeline`.
